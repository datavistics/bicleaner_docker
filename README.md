[Bicleaner](https://github.com/bitextor/bicleaner) is a tool in Python that aims at detecting noisy sentence pairs in a parallel corpus. It indicates the likelihood of a pair of sentences being mutual translations (with a value near to 1) or not (with a value near to 0). Sentence pairs considered very noisy are scored with 0.
